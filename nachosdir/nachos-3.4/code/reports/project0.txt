a) Experience installing Nachos w/ platform details

Installing and building nachos was a straight-forward process. We simply used
wget to download the tarball from the provided URL and extracted the contents
to a directory of our choosing. The platform we're using to compile and run 
NACHOS is Ocelot which is a CentOS 8 system which the school has provided 
remote access to.

b) Experience with the tests

Again, our experience with the tests were smooth and there were no real
surprises. After we compiled Nachos, executing the tests was as simple as
executing any other program in a Unix environment. The threads program ran as
expected, printing out how many times each of the two threads looped. After the
four loops and the program finishes execution, the machine halts and displays 
additional statistical information such as the number of ticks passed. The 
userprog demo also ran as expected, simply printing a halt message and the same 
statistical information.

c) A description of the Thread class in nachos.

The Thread class, as described by comments found within the Nachos source code,
describes a "thread control block" data-structure which represents a single
thread of execution. Threads have a fixed stack size of 4KB + 2 pages and are 
also capable of allocating memory for their stack Threads have a status member
indicating if the thread is currently running, ready or blocked. Threads can be 
forked, yield the processor to other threads, put to sleep or finished. 
Threads can also check if the stack has been overflowed.
