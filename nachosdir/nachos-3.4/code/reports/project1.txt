Excercise 1:

Running the program with the first set of modifications, forking `n` new
threads, results in the following behavior.

SimpleThread gets called by multiple threads. The delay between each thread is
so small that when the value of SharedVariable get updated, the value of val is
essentially the same. This results in SharedVariable having the same value in
each iteration for each thread. The correct behavior would be for the main
thread to enter the loop in SimpleThread, set val to 0 because SharedValue is
0, yield execution to the next thread, and write val+1, or in this case 1, to
SharedVariable before yielding execution to the next thread. This behavior
should repeat a total of 5 times.
